Project Title: YAG's Automotive Research (Milestone Project)

Description:  This program is a proof-of-concept for a site designed to assist the user in researching and gathering the necessary information to purchase a vehicle or find out information about any vehicle. The site consists of 5 pages: index.html, reviews.html, recalls.html, search.html, and about.html. Each page has its own dedicated JavaScript page, titled the same as its corresponding html page. That is, recalls.js is for the recalls.html page, about.js is for the about.html page, and so on. The website is designed to be a one-stop shop for information on vehicles, with the intent being to provide the user with enough material information to allow him/her to effect an aquisition transaction to their benefit.

Use:  The website was designed with accessibility and simplicity as the core pillars. It's designed to provide useful information in a clear, concise and straightforward manner without "flash" and "pizazz". 

Because this site is desgined to be a proof-of-concept, it does not contain all of the functionality that it would had it been a full-on deployable website open to the public. All the error checking on all the pages is functional, however, so all that's needed is to hook up the site to a proper back end/ server set up and it'll be a fully functioning web site.
